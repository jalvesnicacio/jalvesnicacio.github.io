abstract = {Context: Android operating system always brings new releases and updates to improve
security, increase performance and bring a better user experience. When Google announces
a new release, a whole chain of changes is triggered in cascade, causing many compatibility
issues. Objective: This study focus at performing a quantitative and qualitative analysis
on the state of apps readiness for new Android releases over time. Method: We performed
an empirical study to map apps readiness to different Android versions. We developed
a Repository Mining Tool to analyse 8420 open-source repositories, detecting 2118
Android projects and when they were adapted to different Android versions along their
lifetimes. Results: Our results show that Android apps have became "less ready" over
time. We found that 76.45% of the analysed apps were ready for Android Lollipop 5.0
(API level 21) release, in October 2014. Though only 5.46% were ready for Android
10 (API level 29), in September 2019. In addition, our results show that when apps
are adapted to an Android version, 59.41% perform the adaptation until the new Android
release month, 95% are adapted twelve months after the release, and 99.16% are adapted
two years later. Conclusion: Our findings reveal implications that affect not only
the Android or mobile development research field and developers, they also reveal
implications that points to Google's policies and Android final users as well.},
