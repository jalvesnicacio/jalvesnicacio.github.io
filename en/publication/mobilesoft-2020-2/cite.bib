abstract = {Android operating system introduces new releases frequently. This fact led to the
existence of several Android Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which is one
of the causes of the Android fragmentation phenomenon. As a consequence of fragmentation,
many apps became not ready for new Android releases. Aiming at investigation of the
readiness of Android apps, we developed a software repository mining tool to understand
how ready apps are (and were) for Android releases. The tool tracks the changes of
Android projects properties over time, contributing for a deeper analysis through
collecting data since the beginning of the projects. It allows researchers to examine
when exactly Android properties were changed, how many times they were changed, as
well as all their values along time. This mechanism can support researchers to understand
the evolution of Android projects and to answer research questions. In addition, developers
can use the tool to track their apps evolution and perform comparisons and analysis
with other open source apps. The tool can help developers to have a broader view of
their apps evolution as well as to analyze competitor apps evolution.},
